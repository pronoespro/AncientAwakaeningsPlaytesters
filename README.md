# AncientAwakaeningsPlaytesters
Only for playtesters, does not contain the code of the mod itself

In this version, all the charms are available, but only a couple actually work:
-Defender's Roll causes you to turn into a ball AFTER healing yourself (the ball makes you faster, jump higher and damage enemies on contact, but disables double jumps, dashes and attacks). You only stay in that form for almost a second, but quick focus and deep focus change that amount.
-Sibling's Strength has been slightly modified
-Void Scratch causes slow poison damage to enemies, but it stacks, dealing more damage and for longer
-Void Soul and Friend Knight do NOT work, but the void meter they use does

As a side note, there is a mod option for Zote's 57 Precepts that causes your nail and spells to not deal damage to enemies, so you have to be creative on how to fight.

Have fun and don't forget some wise words from an old game: "It's a secret to everyone"
